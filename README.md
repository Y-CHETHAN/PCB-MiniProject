# Design and Develop a PCB Board

## Aim:
To design and develop a PCB board for any specific application.

## Design Steps:
1. Design the schematic using Eagle.
2. Create the PCB layout in Eagle, ensuring proper component placement and trace routing.
3. Generate Gerber files in Eagle for manufacturing.
4. Import the Gerber files into CopperCAM and generate GCODE.
5. Set up the PCB prototyping machine and load the PCB blank.
6. Load the GCODE into the machine's control software.
7. Run the machine to mill traces, drill holes, and cut out the PCB.

## G-Code:
### Engraving
```

```
### Drill
```

```
### Cutout
```

```
